# HRSG

## Python modeller for triple pressure Steam plant and it's corresponding Heat recovery steam generator (HRSG)
### Dependencies:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- iapws

Run program from within HRSG file. It's hacked together atm, but will eventually have at least _some_ degree of intuition
Program generates csv files for the steam cycle thermodynamic conditions at each point as well as each components required work or heat.
